This project implements the Bubble Sort algorithm in C. The function sorts an array of integers in ascending order and prints the array after each swap.

## Files

- `sort.h`: Header file containing the necessary function prototypes and data structures.
- `0-bubble_sort.c`: Source file implementing the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- `0-O`: File containing the Big O notations for the Bubble Sort algorithm.

## Compilation

All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following options:
